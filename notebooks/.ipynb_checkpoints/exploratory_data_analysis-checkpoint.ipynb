According to shocked witnesses the man and woman were sitting in the restaurant on Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville at 12.30 on Sunday morning. Suddenly they became embroiled in a huge fight over whether or not she was entitled to one of the popular ice cream treats - at which point she went outside and proceeded to set the man's car on fire. Scroll Down for Video . Burning: The 1994 El Dorado burns in the parking lot of the McDonald's on Beach Boulevard near St. Johns Bluff in Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday . 'They were going at it,' said witness Sabryna Maré of the couple who were standing behind her in line. 'She was saying she wanted this and wanted that, and she wanted either a McFlurry or an ice cream on top and he was not in for it. Then he was yelling at her saying he's not going to do it.' At this point the argument escalated out of hand and the woman began making seemingly outrageous threats.

'I am going to blow it up': The man quickly discovered that the woman was talking about his car . Smoke: The firefighters arrived to put the flames out and couldn't find any trace of the man or woman . At this point the woman burst out of the restaurant and within minutes the shocked patrons of the McDonalds saw 1994 El Dorado in flames in the parking lot. 'She got something out of the car that happened to be a bottle and then she got gasoline from who knows where. Then she poured everything all over it and next thing you know there was a match and it was up in flames,' said Maré. Witnesses tried to put the fire out but when the firefighters arrived the car was beyond help. The woman who is thought to have started the fire disappeared out of the parking lot and the police are keen to speak to her and the man who vanished after the flames were put out.

Mary Cheney, the openly gay daughter of one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney’s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, aired her views on gay marriage on Friday by saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for 'judges' or 'legislators.' Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, responded by posting on her personal Facebook page: 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.' Black sheep? Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney (left) has announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage despite having a gay married sister, Mary Cheney (right) Sibling disputes: Even though their father backs gay marriage to an extent, Liz Cheney has now come out stating her opposition to such act. Her sister Mary (pictured left) has in turn blasted her sister for holding such views . Opinionated: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, sharply criticized her sister¿s stance on same-sex marriage and urged her own Facebook friends to share the message . She . continued:\\xa0 “Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all . families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all . families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as . every other.” 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.' She concluded her post stating: 'Please like and share if you agree.' Liz . Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike . Enzi in the state’s Republican primary. The election is slated for next . year. Partner: Liz's sister Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe (left) in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks . Departure: Even Liz's father Dick Cheney, seen here with Liz in 2011, supports gay marriage. 'My general view is freedom means freedom for everyone,' he said back in 2004 . ‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney said in a statement released by her campaign. Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month. Since then, she has accused the Enzi campaign of running ‘push poll,’ reports ABC News, one in which voters are asked ‘Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?’ The Enzi campaign has categorically denied the claims, but Cheney has now pushed back with her unequivocal declaration. Former Vice President . Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage, however he . line with Elizabeth’s stance, he has reportedly said the matter should . be decided on a state-by-state basis. Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?' Family does matter in the runup to next fall's Senate elections: Candidates are wielding famous political pedigrees in a number of races that could determine whether Democrats maintain control in the 2014 elections . LIz's stance is also a slight departure in regards to her high profile family. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. ‘Lynne . and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar . with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while . stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of . relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone.

Up in flames: The house was completely destroyed by this morning . Stable: Chad Watson and daughter Kylie are in critical but stable condition at a hospital in Nashville . Police say that 11 people were inside the house when a neighbor called to report the fire around 2am. The small home had no more than three bedrooms, meaning the family was 'piled-up' in the small living space. By the time firefighters arrived, the home was already 'fully engulfed' in flames. Neighbor Clarence Humphrey told WBKO that she woke up to the sound of sirens and saw flames. 'I knew they weren't getting out. I just froze - went numb really,' Ms Humphrey said. Investigators are looking into what caused the blaze, but said  that it doesn't appear suspicious in nature. Recke said it's still too early to know what caused the fire but that last night's cold temperatures could be to blame. Temperatures went all the way down to 1 degree last night, in a region accustomed to 35 degree weather in January. 'I'm thinking that they probably, maybe had space heaters because of this weather,' Recke told NBC. Neighbor Laura Bennett said it was so cold that when firefighters arrived, the water turned to ice as they started to put out the flames. She says 8-year-old Samuel Watson, who died in the fire, was over the night before to play with her daughter. 'He went home and then 10 hours later he's gone,' she said.

      "Example 5: {'article': \"When she began her career as a professional sheep dog Floss was impressive - the sheep responded well to her, she was faster than your average and she certainly looked good. But farmer Dave Issac has reluctantly decided to sell Floss as she is now too big to get through his farmyard gates - because she is  a Peugeot estate car. Mr Issac, 46, who lives on an 180-acre farm near Battle in East Sussex, converted the family car into a working sheep dog in tribute to his dog which had recently died. Scroll down for video . Farmer Dave Issac, 46, (pictured) spent £2,000 converting his\\xa0Peugeot car into a replica of his favourite dog . He spent £2,000 covering the family car in fur and modifying it until it became an exact replica of Floss, his favourite sheep dog. Floss the sheep dog car, who has a top speed of 40mph, soon proved to be a surprisingly effective herder as the flock of sheep failed to notice they were being rounded up by a much larger animal with headlamps for eyes and an exhaust. Mr Issac, who also has a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle, said: 'I know it was a bit of a mad thing to do but it was a tribute to my old sheep dog Floss who passed away. 'I have three kids and we loved her and as a family we all missed her terribly. Mr Issac built a wooden frame and covered the estate car in fur following the death of his favourite sheep dog . The giant car has proven to be an excellent herder - as the sheep don't seem to have noticed the difference . 'So I got together with a friend and we built Floss the sheep dog car in my barn, copying as closely as I could every last detail of my old dog. 'Sheep aren't known for their intelligence and they didn't seem to notice the difference so they were quite happy. 'We even had a charity day on the farm and the car was a big hit.' Mr Issac's unusual experiment has come to an end as Floss the car is simply too big to get around the farm . But Floss the car, which is not licensed to drive on public roads, is now too big to navigate along the narrow farm tracks and through the gates to Mr Issac's fields. Because Floss also required a timber frame built around the Peugeot's chassis to attach the fur, the car is now taking up too much space in the barn of a busy working farm. Mr Issac has decided to sell faithful Floss on eBay and hopes she will go to a good home . Mr Issac added:'They were things we didn't really consider when we built her so with a heavy heart she is going on E-bay. 'It's been a lot of fun and she handles well, is obedient and nice and docile and surprisingly aerodynamic. 'But its back to the tried and tested traditional skills of the sheep dog again.' Mr Isaac hopes Floss the sheep dog car may interest festival organisers or dog charities as a fun car. 'As long as she goes to a good home I'll be happy,' he said.

For 11 years, Barbie (right) doll had been top of Christmas list for parents of girls.\\xa0Now, Frozen is No.1 (left) with one in five parents buying merchandise from film . Around one in five parents are planning to buy an item of merchandise from the animated film for their daughters, according to the annual Holiday Top Toys survey from America's National Retail Federation. While 20 per cent of parents are relying on the children's film to bring a smile to their girl's face on Christmas morning, 16 per cent of mothers and fathers are still planning on purchasing a Barbie - it is the first time in the survey's history that the brand has been beaten. The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year. By June, it had already made $1.2 billion (£765,198,768) worldwide at the box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of all time. The movie's catchy soundtrack has sold more than a million copies and been streamed more than eight million times on Spotify, it has also spawned numerous copycat videos on YouTube of children singing with their parents. The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year . The success didn't just translate to sales figures though - UK parenting website Babycentre reported earlier this year that the name Elsa had gone from No.331 in the list of girls' baby names to No.88. While Frozen has proved a hit with children around the world, the plot-line was also attractive to the parents. Much has been made of Elsa and Anna being good role models for young girls, with their strong personalities and their close bond of sisterhood. And now, the popularity of the film means it is expected to dominate the toy market too. While the success of Elsa and her frozen friends has been undoubtedly created by the movie, Barbie has also had a difficult year in terms of press. The doll's makers have tried hard to bring the doll into the 21st century, with versions of the toy including Business Barbie and a 'Share A Smile Becky' doll that featured Barbie in a wheelchair. Mattel have tried hard to bring the doll into the 21st century, with versions of the toy including Business Barbie (right) and a 'Share A Smile Becky' doll that featured Barbie in a wheelchair. (left) But Mattel has still been marred by criticism that Barbie's figure is completely out of proportion to a normal woman, therefore creating unrealistic standards for young girls. They also attracted negative publicity earlier this month for a book called 'Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer,' which actually showed Barbie needing the help of her male friends to do the job. The response to the book was so negative that Mattel was forced to removed the product from shelves and promise that it would only write\\xa0story-lines\\xa0in the future that would inspire girls. With its distinctive pink packaging, Barbie will also have been hit by the recent argument for toy stores to move away from gender stereotypes for children. 1: Disney Frozen 20.0% . 2: Barbie 16.8% . 3: Dolls 10.7% . 4: Monster High 5.2% . 5: American Girl 3.8% . 6: LEGO 3.1% . 7: Tablet/Apple iPad 3.0% . 8: My Little Pony 2.1% . 9: Disney Doc McStuffins 1.9% . 10: Apparel 1.8% . 1: LEGO 14.2% . 2: Cars & Trucks 8.1% . 3: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 7.7% . 4: Video Games 7.5% . 5: Hot Wheels 4.6% . 6: Xbox One 4.4% . 7: PlayStation 4 4.2% . 8: Transformers 3.5% . 9: Remote Controlled Vehicle 2.7% . 10: Marvel Action Figures 2.3% . While there has been a shake-up of sorts in the girls Christmas present sector this year, little has changed in the boys market. Lego have maintained the top spot for parents buying gifts for their sons, with the general 'cars and trucks', taking the second place. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said: 'Parents will not have to go far to find good deals on the toys their children have put at the top of their lists.

      "Example 9: {'article': '(CNN) -- Not too long ago, students had to craft an essay if they wanted to win a scholarship. Now, they just can craft a tweet. The Kentucky Fried Chicken Foundation is asking eligible high school seniors to tweet a photo that illustrates their commitment to education and enriching their communities. The KFC Colonel\\'s Scholars winner, announced December 15, will receive up to $5,000 per year to pursue a bachelor\\'s degree at a public university in his or her home state. KFC started the Twitter contest last year as a way of reinvigorating its scholarship program for the social media age. The competition saw over 2,800 applicants, with the winning tweet coming from California high school senior Amanda Russell: \"#KFCScholar Hey Colonel! Your scholarship\\'s the secret ingredient missing from my recipe for success! Got the grades, drive, just need cash!\" Other organizations, perhaps weary of wading through applicants\\' lengthy essays, also are offering eager students ways to turn a 140-character message into money for college. Last summer Scholarships.com awarded a \"Short and Tweet\" $1,000 cash prize and Amazon Kindle e-readers to three students who tweeted winning answers to questions like, \"What would an extra $1,000 for college mean to you?\" \"No lengthy essay, no pile of paperwork -- just your thoughts, in real time,\" promised the contest\\'s website. \"To enter, simply log on to Twitter ...\" In place of an essay, the University of Iowa\\'s Tippie College of Business offered a full $38,000 scholarship to its MBA program for the best tweet from a prospective student. \"That\\'s right, it\\'s a 140-character application that pays $271 per letter,\" said the school\\'s website. Why a tweet? Jodi Schafer, the University of Iowa\\'s director of MBA admissions and financial aid, told USA Today that application essays were \"becoming unoriginal.\" She said \"we\\'re hoping that incorporating social media in the process will help bring back some of that creativity.\" Applicants were encouraged to include in their tweet links to blogs, videos or Facebook accounts. The college plans to bring back the tweeting scholarship next year to international applicants. Competitions like these are done more for marketing purposes than finding qualified candidates, said Sree Sreenivasan, a digital-media professor who teaches classes on Twitter at Columbia Journalism School. He cited a scholarship sponsored by Dr. Pepper that was awarded to a girl who threw the most football passes into a giant Dr. Pepper can at the SEC Championship game. \"How is that better or worse than Twitter?\" he asked. Sreenivasan believes these scholarships get buzz because they are \"marketing to the extreme.\" He said he would not be surprised to see more competitions like this in the future, because marketers are very imitative. This year\\'s KFC scholarship competition explores students\\' creativity in a different way by asking them to tweet a picture instead of just a snippet of text. The ideal image should capture their high school experiences and collegiate dreams. KFC Public Relations Manager Rick Maynard says snapping pictures and sharing them online comes naturally to this generation of students, and the scholarship is a new way to connect with social-networking teens. \"The Colonel was a lifelong learner, reinventing himself at the age of 65 when he turned a $105 Social Security check into what would become a global chicken chain. He would have been thrilled to see how KFC continues to adapt to fit the changing consumer landscape,\" Maynard said. Maynard said KFC is watching for new technological trends to help the company decide what to do for next year\\'s competition. In the meantime, students may submit photos until December 13, and the winner will be named around December 15.', 'highlights': 'KFC offers a $20,000 scholarship for the student who tweets the best picture .\\nIn a sign of the times, tweets have replaced essays for some scholarship contests .\\nUniversity of Iowa gave $38,000 scholarship for best tweet from prospective MBA student .', 'id': '1c7a07a94ce387ac71bee74b7191ea18b13103a2'}\n"
